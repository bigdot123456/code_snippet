code_snippet
============

Some simple but useful source codes, scripts or templates, on networking, programming, algorithm, etc.

Most of them are written by me, while some may be collected from Internet or modified based or public-available codes.

#GetWeb.sh
A simple but powerful script, which can automatically download a website by URL and save it to local directory for offline reference.

#RemoteAuth.sh
A ssh authorized script, which enables you to login into remote host automatically without passwd inputing.

#Safe-rm.sh
A much safer rm script, which can automatically backup removed files, in case deleting useful data (beta version).

#Makefile_template
a simple template of Makefile.

#Autopreview 
a light script plugin for Vim that could automatically preview the definition of variables or functions in a tiny window like source insight. Also be hosted at http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=2228
